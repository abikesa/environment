It seems like the issue stems from the fact that the path to the `myenv` virtual environment is hard-coded and may not be correct or consistent across different machines or setups. Here's a simplified script that will help you create a virtual environment and install the necessary kernels for Python, IRkernel (R), and Stata from VSCode. You can run this script each time you need to set up the environment.

First, make sure you have Python, R, and Stata installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Script

1. **Create the Virtual Environment and Install Packages**

```bash
#!/bin/zsh

# Define the environment directory
ENV_DIR="myenv"

# Remove the existing environment if it exists
if [ -d "$ENV_DIR" ]; then
    rm -rf "$ENV_DIR"
fi

# Create a new virtual environment
python3 -m venv $ENV_DIR

# Activate the virtual environment
source $ENV_DIR/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install Python packages
pip install jupyter jupyterlab ipykernel jupyter-book

# Install IRkernel for R
Rscript -e "install.packages('IRkernel', repos='https://cloud.r-project.org/')"
Rscript -e "IRkernel::installspec(name = 'ir', displayname = 'R')"

# Install Stata kernel (assuming you have Stata installed)
pip install stata_kernel
python -m stata_kernel.install

# Deactivate the virtual environment
deactivate

echo "Environment setup complete."
```

2. **Run the Script**

Save the above script as `setup_environment.sh` and run it from the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x setup_environment.sh
./setup_environment.sh
```

3. **Open VSCode and Configure**

Open VSCode and ensure that the virtual environment is activated. You can do this by selecting the interpreter associated with your virtual environment (`myenv`) in the VSCode Python extension.

### Additional Tips

- **Ensure Consistency:** When switching between different systems, make sure the path to your virtual environment is consistent or update the script accordingly.
- **VSCode Settings:** You might want to set the
